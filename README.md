# SimpleEQ
Simple EQ plugin from tutorial and documentation using juce::dsp. 

Features:
- hi-pass filter with cutoff, slope, and Q
- lo-pass filter with cutoff, slope and Q
- notch EQ with frequency, gain, and Q

I do not claim the code here as my own work â€” just using documentation and a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/i_Iq4_Kd7Rc) to help me learn the JUCE framework.
